# NetworkDesign

This is the code repository for the paper named "Rapid transit network design via convex optimization: the role of sparsity and entropy-based regularizers".

This repository provides the necessary files to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper. It is composed of three folders.  

These folders are:  

- **3-Node Network**: Associated with the experiments in sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2.

- **6-Node Network**: Associated with the experiments in section 6.1.3.

- **9-Node Network**: Associated with the experiments in sections 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4.

- **Seville Network**: Associated with the experiments in section 6.5.
